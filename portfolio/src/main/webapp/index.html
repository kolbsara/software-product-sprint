      <h1>Sara's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>I love art and I love problem solving, i.e. coding! I'm passionate about film and acting, and my hope is to integrate technology with that passion in the future. I'm also deeply passionate about the enviornment and using technology as a means to empower people. I hope to pursue socially driven software projects</p>
